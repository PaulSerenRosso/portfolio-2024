    >Itâ€™s not Rocket Science is a party game where 2 teams of 2 players compete. Their goal is to
    make the highest rocket, then launch it in order to be the first to reach the finish line. There
    are various ways to cooperate or to sabotage the other team. It is a physic-based game, so there
    is a lot of chaos; stacking blocks for building the rocket or controlling the rocket in the
    space will be more difficult than expected.
